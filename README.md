The Labsky is a result of a crossbreed between a Siberian Husky and Labrador Retriever. The Husky Lab mix originated during the 1990s. 
But the history of their parents is not mysterious. Both Siberian Huskies and Labrador Retrievers are household names for pet lovers. The Labrador Retriever has topped the most popular pet list for more than 25 years.
The Siberian Husky breed is almost 3000 years old and originated in the Arctic. Humans brought Huskies to Canada and Alaska. Initially, they pulled sleds to hunt, and since they were great companions, they started becoming popular.
Labrador retrievers originated during the 19th century in Newfoundland. The breed became popular in the United States because of its temperament. Labrador Retrievers were used as gundogs, and they worked on both water and land. The breed is known for being friendly and good with kids. It has become a favorite family dog.
Labrador retriever: They range from medium to large size and have a dense, hard coat. Labrador’s coats typically are yellow, chocolate, or black. The breed’s head is wide, and they have kind eyes. They are known for being friendly and social. Sometimes they seem lazy and with low energy, but in reality, they are enthusiastic and energetic. They can indulge in activities including marathons, fetch, and swimming.
Siberian husky: Don’t let its intimidating looks fool you. Huskies are a gentle and friendly breed that is not known for being aggressive. They make wonderful companions and are highly intelligent.
Huskies also are known for having a sense of humor and can make any activity fun. They also are a high-energy breed that needs to burn off that energy.
Sometimes a pup can look like a Husky, and some can look like a Labrador. It is rare for a Labsky to be a 50/50 split.
The breed is medium-sized and has triangular ears. The color of their eyes ranges from light blue to brown or amber. It is also common for the breed to show heterochromia or have eyes of different colors, most commonly one blue eye and one brown. Their distinctive faces are expressive.
They also have a powerful jaw and a prominent nose.
The dogs typically have facial masks and eyebrows that can be distinctive from the rest of their face. Their bodies are typically lean and athletic. Their distinctive faces are expressive.
Because both Labradors and Huskies are friendly dogs, the Labsky typically has a happy disposition.
They are usually loving and caring for their owners and their guests. They are smart, adorable, active, and energetic.
The crossbreed of the Labrador Retriever and Siberian Husky is a perfect pet for families. It is active, loyal, and extremely loving.
The dogs also are easy to train. But because they have a lot of energy, they need a lot of exercise.
Be prepared for long daily walks and consider activities like agility or flyball. Your Labsky also might enjoy playing with interactive toys.
Because both Huskies and Labs shed, be prepared to deal with a lot of hair. You’ll need to brush their double coats at least every day or two. Expect more shedding when the weather turns warm.
Some Labskies have erect ears, while some have floppy ears. You’ll need to keep their ears clean and take them to the vet for regular checkups. 
The breed is easy to train. They have a happy nature, which makes them fun to work with.
Most of all, Labskies are intelligent. So, they master new commands quickly.
Sometimes, that intelligence can make them a bit lazy or stubborn. While Labs are people pleasers, Huskies, however, can be a bit stubborn.
That’s why it’s critical to combine training with playtime to keep your Labsky engaged.
It is common for dogs to inherit some disease traits from their parents. That’s why it is necessary to take your dog for regular check-ups to monitor their health.
The general lifespan is around 12 years.
But you can help keep your dog active and healthy with exercise and a good diet, so consider feeding them American Journey dog food or another high-quality Labrador puppy food designed to meet the dietary needs of Labsky puppies.
There’s no way of telling the most common issues among Labskies. Because they can inherit the traits of both breeds, it’s critical to recognize the most common threats.
Huskies have a lifespan of 12 to 14 years. They are commonly predisposed to cataracts, corneal dystrophy, zinc deficiency, hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, uveodermatologic syndrome, corneal dystrophy, retinal atrophy (progressive), and follicular dysplasia.
Labradors have a lifespan of around 10 to 12 years. They usually inherit hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, ruptured hind leg ligaments, loose knee joints, heart disease, eye disease, cancer, epilepsy, obesity, chronic allergies, and bloating.
Labskies are prone to hip dysplasia, allergies, hypothyroidism, obesity, and ocular conditions. Like Labs, the Lab Husky mix is prone to becoming overweight if they don’t get enough exercise. The dogs also can suffer from an underactive thyroid, which can make it difficult to lose weight and make the dog more prone to skin infections and inflammation.
Regular vet visits will be critical to keeping your Labsky healthy.
